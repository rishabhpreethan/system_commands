# In a course, the instructor asked the students to submit their projects in a 
# single file named as the studentâ€™s roll number. A typical roll number of a 
# student is a 10 character string which is a combination of a four digit(decimal)
#  year and six character hexadecimal number, e.g. "20201f3acd". 
#  The instructor specified that the name of the file should be in lower case 
#  but some students mistakenly used uppercase for their file names. 
#  Each file name is either entirely in lower case or entirely in upper 
#  case with numbers.

# Your task is to create two arrays(shell variables) named lower and upper. 
# Array lower should not contain the file names that have upper case letters 
# and array upper should contain all the file names that have upper case letters.

# Note: The project files are located in the current directory

# Hint:
# arr=(`ls`) # Each element in arr corresponds to the output from the ls
