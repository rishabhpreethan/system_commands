# Consider a special programming file functions.sh that contains 
# several functions (A function is a block of code). Write a bash 
# script/command using sed to insert a line "# START FUNCTION" before 
# the starting of a function and a line "# END FUNCTION" at the end of the function.
# Starting of a function in this file can be identified as a line that 
# has some string followed by "(", then followed by ")" or some string 
# followed by ")", and this line should end with "{".
# Ending of a function can be identified by a line containing only "}" in the whole line.
# In this file curly braces "{" and "}" are not used for any other 
# purpose. Do not change the original file just print the output to STDOUT.
