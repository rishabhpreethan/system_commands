# We want to change the file permissions of "someFile.txt" file as follows.

# user: execute
# group: execute, read
# others: write

# We will use the command chmod XXX someFile.txt where XXX represents a 3 digit number 
# used to set the above permissions. Write a bash command to create a file named 
# XXX.digits in the current working directory such XXX is the same three digit number 
# used to set the permissions as mentioned above. The file your command creates can be empty.
# For e.g. If your think the command chmod 111 someFile.txt will change the permission 
# of file someFile.txt as mentioned above, then your solution should create a file 
# named 111.digits in the current working directory.
