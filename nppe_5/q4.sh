# In a course, the instructor asked the students to submit their projects in a single 
# file named as the studentâ€™s roll number. A typical roll number of a student is a 10 
# character string which is a combination of a four digit(decimal) year and six 
# character hexadecimal number, e.g. "20201f3acd". The instructor specified that the 
# name of the file should be in lower case but some students mistakenly used uppercase 
# for their file names. Each file name is either entirely in lower case or entirely in 
# upper case with numbers.

# Your task is to create two arrays(shell variables) named lower and upper. Array 
# lower should not contain the file names that have upper case letters and array upper 
# should contain all the file names that have upper case letters.

# Note: The project files are located in the current directory

# Hint: arr=(`ls`)          # Each element in arr corresponds to the output from the ls





#lower=(`ls | grep "^[0-9]\{4\}[0-9a-f]\{6\}"`)
#upper=(`ls | grep "^[0-9]\{4\}[0-9A-F]\{6\}" | grep -v "[0-9]\{6\}$"`)

lower=(`ls |egrep "[[:digit:]]{4}[[:xdigit:]]{6}"|egrep "[[:lower:]]|[[:digit:]]{10}"`);
upper=(`ls |egrep "[[:digit:]]{4}[[:xdigit:]]{6}"|egrep "[[:upper:]]"`);
