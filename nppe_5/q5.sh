# A finance company called `Fintech` does not have its own analytics team, rather they 
# outsources their analytics work to external vendors. The company maintains a file 
# for each investor they are interested in, with the filename in the format 
# 'firstname_lastname' in the directory 'data'(directory 'data' is in the current 
# working directory). They do not want to make their investor details public so they 
# rename each investor file to the hash value of filename before giving it to the 
# external vendors and store the mapping in the file named map. Assume that no two 
# investors have same combination of 'firstname' and 'lastname'.

# The analytics team(external vendor) received the files of several investors named as 
# some hash value. They analysed and identified some potential investors for the 
# company and stored the hashed file names(one on each line) corresponding to the 
# identified investors in a file named 'result'. The 'firstname_lastname' file 
# contains the potential investment amount and duration details. Refer the provided 
# sample data for sample file formats and architecture.

# Write a bash script to print the sum of investment amounts of all the investors 
# identified by the analytics team whose names(hash values) are present in the file 'result'.
