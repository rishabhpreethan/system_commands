# List(in long format, use ls -l) all the .txt files in the current working directory 
# and redirect the output to a file named textFiles.txt and also print 'found' to the 
# terminal(without quotes, do not print anything else).

# If no .txt file exists redirect the error of your command to the file noFiles.txt 
# and do not print anything.

# Hint: Make use of redirection to file and operators to write solution in one line.


ls -l *.txt > textFiles.txt 2> noFiles.txt && echo found
