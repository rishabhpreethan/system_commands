# The file Pincode_info.csv has information on the pin codes of some places. The output of the command head -5 Pincode_info.csv is given below. First line of this file gives the information about the sequence of fields in each line of file following it.

# Circle Name,Region Name,Division Name,Office Name,Pincode,OfficeType,Delivery,District,StateName

# Write a command to display the Circle name and Division name separated by space for 
# the given pincode  stored in a shell variable 'pin'. 
# For  e.g. if 'pincode=515002' then your command should display 'Andhra Pradesh Anantapur'
# Note: If your solution has more than one line, add a semicolon after each line.


circle=`grep $pin Pincode_info.csv | grep -e ".* Circle" -o`
circle=${circle% Circle}
division=`grep $pin Pincode_info.csv | grep -e ",\w* Division" -o`
division=${division:1}
division=${division% Division}
echo $circle $division

# Alternative solution
# circle=`grep "$pin" Pincode_info.csv| grep -oP ".*(?= Circle)"`
# division=`grep "$pin" Pincode_info.csv| grep -oP "\w+(?= Division)"`
# echo $circle $division
