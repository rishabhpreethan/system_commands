# The poem “Sail away” by Rabindranath Tagore is stored in the file named poem.


# Early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat,
# only thou and I, and never a soul in the world would know of this our
# pilgrimage to no country and to no end.

# In that shoreless ocean,
# at thy silently listening smile my songs would swell in melodies,
# free as waves, free from all bondage of words.

# Is the time not come yet?
# Are there works still to do?
# Lo, the evening has come down upon the shore
# and in the fading light the seabirds come flying to their nests.

# Who knows when the chains will be off,
# and the boat, like the last glimmer of sunset,
# vanish into the night?

# Write a command to print the number of non-empty lines that do not contain an 
# article (a, an, the) in it. The command should print a number that is
# the count of lines, and should not print the lines.
