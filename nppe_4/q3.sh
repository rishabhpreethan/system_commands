# Given a shell variable month supposed to contain a string value corresponding to 
# some calendar month. Use the cal command to create a file named as X.txt where 
# X is the string value in the variable month. Your command should also create a 
# file named error.txt that should contain the error message if the string month does 
# not correspond to any calendar month. Create all the files in the current working 
# directory.

# For example:
# If the variable month contains the string "nov", your solution should create a file 
# named nov.txt containing the calendar of november month and error.txt should be empty.
# And if the variable month contains the string "garbage", your solution should create 
# a file named error.txt containing the error from cal command and garbage.txt should be empty.
