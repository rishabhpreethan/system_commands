# Each line in the file employees.csv contains the name, role and division of employees 
# separated by a comma. Every line corresponds to one employee. The user wants to 
# collect the details of employees who are managers in the R&D division. For managers 
# the string for the role is ‘Manager’ and the division string for employees working 
# in the R&D division is ‘R&D’.

# Write a command to collect the required details and redirect the output to a file 
# named “info.csv”. "info.csv" should contain the name, role and division 
# (separated by a comma) of each employee (as per the above criteria) on a separate line.


grep -i "manager" employees.csv | grep "R&D" > info.csv
