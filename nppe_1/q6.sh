# Consider a directory named "perf_folder" containing some files with different 
# extensions, present in the current working directory. Write a bash script that 
# accepts an argument(name of destination directory), adds a prefix string "program_" 
# to the file names in the directory "perf_folder" meeting the below criteria.
# The file extension is ".c".
# The file names should containing the substring perf.

# Also move all the files meeting the above criteria after renaming to the 
# directory(destination) whose name is specified as an argument to your script. 
# The destination directory may or may not be present in the current working 
# directory, if not present create the directory under current working directory.

# For e.g. the argument to your script is perf_programs, i.e. perf_programs is the 
# destination directory for renamed files.

# If below is the output of ls perf_folder when run in your current working directory.

# perf_results.cvc	perf_conf.xml		set_perf_input.c	perf_params.c
# start_test.c	stop_test.c	results.txtscript.sh

# Then after running your script, 
# the new output of  running ls perf_folder in your current working directory should be,

# perf_results.cvc	perf_conf.xml	start_test.c	stop_test.c	results.txt		script.sh
# and output of running command ls perf_programs in your current working directory should be, 

# program_set_perf_input.c	program_perf_params.c
